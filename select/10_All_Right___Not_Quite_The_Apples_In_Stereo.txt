Girl, where I go
I always run another way from the flow
And girl, where I am
I always feel so far away from the plan

So give me your number now
Don't go giving your number out
Give them your number
Might make them go blind

It takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Not quite

Girls that I see
They always look the other way
Away from me
And girl, when I try
Things never seem to go my way
I'm just too high

So give me your number now
Don't go giving your number out
Give them your number
Might make them go blind

Takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Not quite

Girl, my case is weak
My mind is small
My outlook's bleak
But girl, you know I'll come clean
You know I'm an honest man
If that's your scene

So give me your number now
Don't go giving your number out
Give them your number
Might make them go blind

Takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Takes a lot out of me
And it's not hard to see
That I'm alright, but not quite
Not quite
