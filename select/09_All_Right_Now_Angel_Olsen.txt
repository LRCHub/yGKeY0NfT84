It's all here
Now, it's all here
Now, it's all here
Now, it's always been here
It's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's always been right
You do not have to leave
Or go out walking too
You do not have to reach out
To somebody new
You do not have to hold her
In your fingertips
It's always been there with you
You are what it is
And it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's all right
Now, it's always been right
All right, all right
All right, all right
I hear you in my thoughts
I see you in my dreams
I know you're in my mind
And you are everything
Stay, and stay a while
And still reminds
All be here
And start it
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
All right now
