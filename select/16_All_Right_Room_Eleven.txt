All right, I've had enough
I don't wanna do this anymore
All you ever think about is sex
Your vanity, and the way that
I would treat you bad
I don't wanna hear your whining
Quit your naggin n leave me be
Just stay away from me and
Shut your mouth
Turn around
Walk away and leave me

A L O N E!

STOP BUGGIN ME!

I'll walk away I won't look back
Don't wanna look back
I'll leave you behind
There's no turning back this time
