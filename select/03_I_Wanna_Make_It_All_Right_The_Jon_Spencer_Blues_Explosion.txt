I'm going over the hill
I've gotta get that crown
I've got to get on with it, baby
Well, come on and get down
Everybody knows
I've got to rock and roll

I wanna make it all right

Well, I never felt at ease
Always in great pain
Yeah, I'm gonna change my name
Dry up or fade away
Come on out of the cold
And get the rock and roll

I wanna make it all right

Educate the people

I'm gonna fall down on my knees
Crying out for some relief
Get crazy, call out in his name
Well, you know I wanna make it alright

I wanna make it all right
Yes, yes, I wanna make it
All, all, I wanna make it all right

I'm going over the hill
I don't need no crown
I've gotta get happy
I'm gonna stick around

I wanna make it all right
I wanna make it all right
I wanna make it all right
I wanna make it all right
