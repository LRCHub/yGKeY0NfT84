Symone, come home,
You went across the sea to get away from me, baby
Dear girl,
My world is just an empty space without your pretty face

Take the bullet train
Take the airplane
Through the atmosphere
Leave my baby here

It's alright, It's alright
Baby don't you know that it's alright
It's alright, It's alright
Baby don't you know it's all right

Symone, You've grown out of this little town
And now its bringing you down
Dear girl, my world is just an empty shell
Without your magic spell

Take the bullet train
Take the airplane
Through the atmosphere
Leave my baby here

It's alright, It's alright (Maybe it's wrong, maybe its right)
Baby don't you know that it's alright
It's alright, It's alright (Maybe it's wrong, maybe its right)
Baby don't you know it's all right

Come on back home, Come on back ho-oh-ome [x 2]

Take the bullet train
Take the airplane
Through the atmosphere
Leave my baby here

It's alright, It's alright (Maybe it's wrong, maybe its right)
Baby don't you know that it's alright
It's alright, It's alright (Maybe it's wrong, maybe its right)
Baby don't you know it's all right

Come on back home (Come on back ho-oh-ome) (You know it's gonna be alright)
