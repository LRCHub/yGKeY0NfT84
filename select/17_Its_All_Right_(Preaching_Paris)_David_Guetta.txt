From Brooklyn to LA
From Japan and even you Paris
You can have it
You can do whatever you want to do
It's alright, yes, it's alright
And it's ok
Cause trouble don't last away
You know sometimes it goes through such trouble
And we think that nobody, nobody care
It's gonna be alright and it's gonna be ok honey
Because the universe, yes, would let you go down too much
You know that you can feel good about yourself

Cause nobody else is gonna do it for you
So you got to make up your mind
That you're gonna get up and do what you want to happen
And that's all I'm sayin'
There is a winner in you, there is a greatness in you
There is somebody in you
That wants to come out and let you know that
You are somebody
Tou know what, you're gonns go higher, higher, higher
Ang it's alright you know

There is somebody in you
That wants to come out and let you know that
You are somebody
No man can take it away from you, because that's
Your gift that was given from God and you know what
It's gonna be ok
Because you know what, let that last tear fall
Because it's gonna be alright
You don't have to worry about them
And don't even think about them
No negativity or positivity
Bless your enemies that's all I can say
Because when you start blessing them
And say God bless them

And it's alright because it starts turning things around
And working it out in your favour
And you don't have to walk around with a proud on your face
And who you hat cause Mary says "no haterativity" right
So that means you have to love everybody
And when you start feeling the love covering up inside of you
Watch out because you know that all good things
Are going to be handed up to you

I believe
