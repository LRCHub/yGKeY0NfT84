Ain't no use to sit an wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
Oh now ain't no use to sit and wonder why
It won't ever do somehow

Oh when your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and know i'll be gone
Oh you're the reason i'm travelin on
Dont think twice, it's alright

There ain't no use in turnin on your light, babe
The light i've never known
Oh now it ain't no use in turnin on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

Oh now i'm thinkin and i'm wonderin, walkin down the road
Oh i once loved a man of child i am told
Oh i gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright

There ain't no use in callin out my name, boy
Like you never done before
Oh now ain't no use in callin out my name now
Cause i can't hear anymore

Oh i wish there was something you might do or say
Oh to try to make me change my mind and stay
Oh but we never did too much talkin anyways
Don't think twice, it's alright

So long, honey baby
Where i'm bound, i can't tell
Oh but good-bye is too good a word now
So i'll just say fare-thee-well

Oh now i ain't sayin that you treated me unkind
Oh you coulda done better, but oh i don't mind
Oh you just kinda wasted all of my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright

Oh you just kinda wasted all of my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright
